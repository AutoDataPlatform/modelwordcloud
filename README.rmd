## Modelwordcloud

**Modelwordcloud** is a package that makes a word cloud out of text, primarially based on the associations between that text and a predictive model.

```{R, eval=TRUE}
data(iris)
model <- lm(Petal.Width ~ Species, iris)
summary(model)
```

As we can see, setosa (represented by the intercept) is the least associated with Petal.Width, wheras virginica is the most associated.

We can show this in a word cloud:

```{R, eval=TRUE}
words_and_freqs <- rle(as.character(iris$Species))
freqs <- words_and_freqs$lengths
words <- words_and_freqs$values
coefficients <- model$coefficients
colors <- c("red", "orange", "blue")  # Least associated gets red, most associated gets blue.
library(modelwordcloud)
wordcloud(words = words, freq = freqs, coefficients = coefficients, colors = colors)
```
